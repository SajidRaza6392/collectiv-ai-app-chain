# Scripts

This folder will contain helper scripts for:

- building the chain binary,
- starting a local devnet,
- resetting state for testing,
- and other maintenance tasks.

At the moment this is just a placeholder and will be extended
once the first Cosmos-based application skeleton is in place.
